# MyRecipesNotebook

Inspired by MyFitnessPal and in addition to other apps which offer such recipe
management system, the app MyRecipesNotebook, comes with a recommendation
recipe feature.
The goal is to create an web digital notebook application for a person recipes, so
he can have immediate access to them. Even if the user can manage his own recipes,
there are times when he would like to just try something new, based on the cravings
he has at the moment.
A suggestion based functionality is going to be implemented in the application,
so that the user is able to receive recipes recommendations based on the selected
preferences. The idea of this functionality is to utilize various pieces of data to
provide the customer valuable suggestions.
